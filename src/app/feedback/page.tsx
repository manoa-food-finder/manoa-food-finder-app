          With the Manoa Food Finder app, finding on campus food options is easy for students.
          The map is simple and easy to use, and vendors are able to add posts in a simple manner.
          It reminds me of twitter, but for on campus food.

          Users who used the Manoa Food Finder app noted how simple the layout was, and that the site was easy to
          understand and navigate at a glance. One of our participants noted how the app reminded them of twitter, with
          posts that can be scrolled through posted by different vendors. It makes viewing special deals or events at
          different restraunts much easier than the current system, and permitted for users to learn of new places on
          campus through the listings. The overall experience with the app was simple, efficient and quick.
